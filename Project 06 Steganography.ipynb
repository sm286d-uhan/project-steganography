Captured and forced to appear in a propaganda video, he communicated home by blinking his eyes in Morse code, spelling out the word \"TORTURE\", confirming that prisoners of war were being tortured by the North Vietnamese. RADM Denton had a distinguished career following his return from Vietnam, serving as a U.S. Senator for his home state of Alabama. His experiences in Vietnam are recounted in his book, *When Hell was in Session*. A similar incident involved the crew of the USS Pueblo, who were captured by North Korea in 1968. They used American sign language to hide messages in propaganda videos; also look closely at Figure 1 below."

The top four bits of $167 = [$<font color=\"red\">1010</font>$0111]_2$ are 1010 and we can hide these in the bottom four bits of the cover image's Red component by replacing the original cover image's Red component $204 = [11001100]_2$ with $[1100$<font color=\"red\">1010</font>$]_2 = 192 + [$<font color=\"red\">1010</font>$]_2 = 192+10=202$.

This has the effect of clearing out the 4 lowest-order bits. In our example above we replace $204 = [11001100]_2$ with $192 = [11000000]_2$. Then we shift the Red component for the secret image pixel by 4 bits to the right. In our example, $167 = [10100111]_2$ is replaced by $10 = [00001010]_2$. Adding the two bytes together gives the new Red component for the steganography image pixel (the cover image with the secret image inside it) of $192+10 = [11000000]_2 + [00001010]_2 = [11001010]_2 = 202$.
